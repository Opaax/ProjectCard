# Project Card

I'm a big of Dragon ball world. I loved playing Dragon ball Dokkan battle.

I start to make this project with cards with the team building mecanics that dokkan got.
However, I wanted to make a 3D project so, you can place your card and the world, and like YuGiOh a 3D object will appear.
Long time ago Dokkan did realese an alpha for an exotic game like clash royal.
