# Project Card

I'm a big of Dragon Ball world. I loved playing Dragon Ball Dokkan battle.

I start to make this project with cards with the team-building mechanics that Dokkan got.
However, I wanted to make a 3D project so, you can place your card and the world, and like YuGiOh a 3D object will appear.
A long time ago Dokkan did release an alpha for an exotic game like clash royal.
